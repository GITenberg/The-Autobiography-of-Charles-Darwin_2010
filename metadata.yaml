description: "The Autobiography of Charles Darwin is an autobiography by the English\
  \ naturalist Charles Darwin.\nDarwin wrote the text, which he entitled Recollections\
  \ of the Development of my Mind and Character, for his family. He states that he\
  \ started writing it on about May 28, 1876 and had finished it by August 3.\nThe\
  \ text was published in 1887 (five years after Darwin's death) by John Murray as\
  \ part of The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical\
  \ chapter. The text printed in Life and Letters was edited by Darwin's son Francis\
  \ Darwin, who removed several passages about Darwin's critical views of God and\
  \ Christianity.\nThe omitted passages were later restored by Darwin's granddaughter\
  \ Nora Barlow in a 1958 edition to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the publication\
  \ of The Origin of Species. This edition was published in London by Collins under\
  \ the title of The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809-1882. With the original\
  \ omissions restored. Edited and with appendix and notes by his granddaughter Nora\
  \ Barlow.\nThe original is in the public domain as its copyright has expired, but\
  \ the later version remains under copyright. Both are available online at Darwin\
  \ Online.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
